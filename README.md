## Weeks

### Week 1
#### FizzBuzz
A coding challenge where numbers must be listed, but if the number is a multiple of 3 it lists "Fizz", and if it is a multiple of 5 it lists "Buzz", with multiples of both being "FizzBuzz".
#### Challenge 1
A coding challenge where I must sum up the numbers below 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.
#### Challenge 2
A coding challenge where I must make a sentence be rearranged into ascending order based on word size.
#### Challenge 3
A coding challenge where I must return the number of coins needed to be flipped over to make a set of coins have an even amount of heads or tails.
#### Challenge 4
A coding challenge where I must check whether a word is palindromic, or how many palindromes are in a sentence.
#### Challenge 5
A coding challenge where I must flip a name (Put the surname before the forename) or a list of names without using string.split.
