# Java Playground

This is where I come to practice Java, be it with coding challenges or just general practice. This is also set up so that I can test my code.

## Challenges
* #### FizzBuzz
A coding challenge where numbers must be listed, but if the number is a multiple of 3 it lists "Fizz", and if it is a multiple of 5 it lists "Buzz", with multiples of both being "FizzBuzz".
* #### SumOfMultiples
A coding challenge where I must sum up the numbers below 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5.
* #### AscendWordSizes
A coding challenge where I must make a sentence be rearranged into ascending order based on word size.
* #### CoinFlipEqualiser
A coding challenge where I must return the number of coins needed to be flipped over to make a set of coins have an even amount of heads or tails.
* #### PalindromicNameChecker
A coding challenge where I must check whether a word is palindromic, or how many palindromes are in a sentence.
* #### NameFlipperSplitless
A coding challenge where I must flip a name (Put the surname before the forename) or a list of names without using string.split.
* #### ArrayMerge
A coding challenge where I must merge two arrays, and be able to return the result normally, sorted, sorted backwards and without duplicates.

## Core
### ArrayFunctions
* #### ArrayDupeRemover
Class containing a static function that will remove duplicates from an array.
* #### ArrayExamples
Small place to experiment with the different collections.
* #### ArrayFlipper
Class containing a static function that will flip a given array.


### BubbleSort
* #### BubbleSort (Interface)
An interface for bubble sort algorithms.
* #### BubbleSortIntArray
A bubble sort algorithm that will sort an array of ints into ascending order.
* #### BubbleSortStringWordSize
A bubble sort algorithm that will sort a string into ascending order based on word size.

&nbsp;
* #### BinarySearch
A simple binary search algorithm I created for arrays of ints.
* #### Main
Although this is the entry point of the repo, not much is done here. Currently used with an array for the ArrayExamples file.

## Testing
All code in this repository is either already tested or going to be tested. I am currently working on cutting down the number of tests I do while maintaining the quality.

The testing files are laid out in the exact same way as the main coding files, so if you are looking for the tests for a certain class then follow the same path under "test" and you will make it there.
